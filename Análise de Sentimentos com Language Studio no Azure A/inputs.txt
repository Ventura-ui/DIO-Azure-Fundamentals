1)  Good Hotel and staff
 The Royal Hotel, London, UK
 3/2/2018
 Clean rooms, good service, great location near Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey,
 and so on. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The courtyard is very peaceful and we went to a restaurant which
 is part of the same group and is Indian ( West coast so plenty of fish) with a Michelin Star.
 We had the taster menu which was fabulous. The rooms were very well appointed with a kitchen, lounge, bedroom and enormous bathroom. Thoroughly recommended.


2) Ontém fui no jogo de futebol num estádio aqui da cidade, foi super divertido meu time saiu campeão.
